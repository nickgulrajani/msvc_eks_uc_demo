# 🚀 Microservices EKS Deployment Demo

> **Perfect for Technical Interviews** - Complete microservices architecture demonstration with EKS, ECR, and GitHub Actions

## 🎯 Overview

This project demonstrates a **production-ready microservices architecture** deployed to AWS EKS using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and automated CI/CD (GitHub Actions). Designed to showcase enterprise-level DevOps and cloud engineering skills **without incurring AWS costs**.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Microservices Stack
- **🌐 API Gateway** (Node.js/Express) - Traffic routing, rate limiting, authentication
- **👥 User Service** (Python/FastAPI) - User management, JWT authentication  
- **📦 Order Service** (Go/Gin) - High-performance order processing
- **📧 Notification Service** (Java/Spring Boot) - Event-driven notifications

### Infrastructure
- **☸️ Amazon EKS** - Managed Kubernetes cluster with auto-scaling
- **🐳 Amazon ECR** - Private container registry with vulnerability scanning
- **🌐 Application Load Balancer** - Traffic distribution and SSL termination
- **🔒 VPC** - Multi-AZ networking with public/private subnets
- **📊 CloudWatch** - Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### 2. **Demonstrate the Pipeline** (3-5 minutes)
```bash
# Push to trigger the complete pipeline
git push origin demo
```
- Watch real-time execution in GitHub Actions
- Show comprehensive testing across all services
- Demonstrate Terraform infrastructure planning
- Review security and compliance scanning

### 3. **Explain Infrastructure** (3-4 minutes)
- **Terraform modules** for reusable infrastructure
- **EKS cluster** with managed node groups
- **ECR repositories** with lifecycle policies
- **Cost analysis** and optimization strategies

### 4. **Highlight DevOps Excellence** (2-3 minutes)
- **Zero-downtime deployments** with rolling updates
- **Auto-scaling** based on metrics
- **Security hardening** with least privilege
- **Monitoring and observability** with Prometheus/Grafana

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Monthly Cost Breakdown
| Component | Cost | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| EKS Cluster | ~$73 | Control plane (after free tier) |
| EC2 Instances | ~$60 | 2x t3.medium worker nodes |
| NAT Gateways | ~$135 | 3x NAT for private subnet access |
| Load Balancer | ~$25 | Application Load Balancer |
| ECR Storage | ~$5 | Container image storage |
| **Total** | **~$298** | **Without Free Tier benefits** |

### 💡 Cost Optimization Features
